To make the final report a bit more scholastic 
it would help place it within the context of existing 
literature. Here are some suggestions:

One of the areas that may be of particular interest to psychologists and 
public health expers is the topic of self-report bias.

Another topic that may be relevant here is the data quality, in particular the 
smoothing done by iOS devices in comparison to raw measurements from 
android devices.  

Finaly, the search through friends has revealed a style of social network
among the mapmyhealth participants. There may be some relationships among
the individuals within each cluster. This is a topic of future research, however.
